What's the status of this project?
----------------------------------

As of mid-2021 Geoxarray is being actively developed, but slowly. Geoxarray
is still in its early stages and will heavily depend on other projects like
xarray, rasterio, pyresample, and pyproj. Some of the intended features for
Geoxarray are still wishful thinking and will depend on changes
in other scientific Python libraries and decisions by the larger community
that Geoxarray will get the most of Geoxarray.
